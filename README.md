# Adaptive Laguerre Moving Average (ALMA) Indicator

This repository contains a Python class for calculating the Adaptive Laguerre Moving Average (ALMA) indicator. ALMA is a moving average that adapts to market volatility, providing a smoother trend-following indicator.

## Overview

The `ALMAIndicator` class is a part of the `ta` library (Technical Analysis library) and calculates the ALMA indicator for a given time series of closing prices. The ALMA indicator utilizes exponential weighting and adapts to market conditions, making it useful for trend analysis.

**Optimized for Space and Time Complexity:** The `ALMAIndicator` implementation in this repository is designed for efficient performance with respect to space and time complexity. It aims to provide accurate ALMA calculations while minimizing resource usage.

## Usage

To use the `ALMAIndicator`, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies using:
pip install numpy pandas technical-analysis

2. Import the required libraries and the `ALMAIndicator` class

# Conclusion
The ALMAIndicator class allows you to easily calculate the Adaptive Laguerre Moving Average (ALMA) indicator for a given set of closing prices. This optimized implementation aims to strike a balance between performance and accuracy, making it suitable for use in various trading and analysis scenarios.

Feel free to customize the code and integrate it into your technical analysis toolkit.
