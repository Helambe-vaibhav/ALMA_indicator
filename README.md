# ALMA_indicator
# Adaptive Laguerre Moving Average (ALMA) Indicator

This repository contains a Python class for calculating the Adaptive Laguerre Moving Average (ALMA) indicator. ALMA is a moving average that adapts to market volatility, providing a smoother trend-following indicator.

## Overview

The `ALMAIndicator` class is a part of the `ta` library (Technical Analysis library) and calculates the ALMA indicator for a given time series of closing prices. The ALMA indicator utilizes exponential weighting and adapts to market conditions, making it useful for trend analysis.

**Optimized for Space and Time Complexity:** The `ALMAIndicator` implementation in this repository is designed for efficient performance with respect to space and time complexity. It aims to provide accurate ALMA calculations while minimizing resource usage.

## Usage

To use the `ALMAIndicator`, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies using:
pip install numpy pandas technical-analysis

python
Copy code

2. Import the required libraries and the `ALMAIndicator` class:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from ta.utils import IndicatorMixin

class ALMAIndicator(IndicatorMixin):
python'''
 # Class implementation...
Create an instance of the ALMAIndicator class by providing the closing price series and the desired window size:
close_prices = ...  # Replace with your closing price series
window_size = ...    # Replace with your desired window size
alma_indicator = ALMAIndicator(close_prices, window_size)
Use the alma method to calculate the ALMA values:

alma_values = alma_indicator.alma()
Parameters
close: A pandas Series containing the closing prices.
window: The window size used for calculating the ALMA.
fillna: A boolean indicating whether to fill NaN values. Default is False.
Example
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from ta.utils import IndicatorMixin

# Your code implementation...

close_prices = pd.Series(...)  # Replace with your closing price data
window_size = 14  # Example window size
alma_indicator = ALMAIndicator(close_prices, window_size)
alma_values = alma_indicator.alma()

print(alma_values)
Conclusion
The ALMAIndicator class allows you to easily calculate the Adaptive Laguerre Moving Average (ALMA) indicator for a given set of closing prices. This optimized implementation aims to strike a balance between performance and accuracy, making it suitable for use in various trading and analysis scenarios.

Feel free to customize the code and integrate it into your technical analysis toolkit.
